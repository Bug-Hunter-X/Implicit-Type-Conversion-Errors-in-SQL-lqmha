This repository demonstrates a common SQL error related to implicit type conversions. Implicit type conversion occurs when the database automatically converts data types during comparisons or operations.  This can lead to unexpected behavior, especially when comparing numeric and string types. The `bug.sql` file contains the flawed query. `bugSolution.sql` presents a corrected version utilizing explicit conversions. This example highlights the importance of explicit type conversions in SQL to avoid unpredictable outcomes and ensure query portability.
